# ü©∫ ImageCLEF Medical Caption


This repository hosts a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that presents a solution for automatically generating captions for radiology images; a multi-label classifiaction task. The notebook implements an image captioning pipeline designed for the [Image CLEF 2019 Concept Detection Challenge](https://www.imageclef.org/2019/medical/caption/) and incorporates data preprocessing, feature extraction, deep learning model training, and evaluation steps.


## Overview

- The project addresses the challenge of generating descriptive multi-label captions tailored to radiology images.
- It leverages deep learning techniques, including a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a pre-trained model.
- The notebook provides a detailed walkthrough‚Äîfrom loading and preprocessing data to training the captioning model and assessing performance using evaluation metrics.
